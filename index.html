  <h1>THE AKAN NAMES</h1>
  <p>Akan names were derived from the Akan people of ghana who name their children after the day of the week.
    These day names have further meaning concerning the soul and character of the person.
    The names can also refer to the birth order of syblings.
    Ghanaians have at least one name from this system.An example is the well known revolutionary and first prime
    minister of ghana <strong>Kwame Nkrumah</strong>.

  <p>In the ceremony of giving children their akan names a mat is spread on the floor and the child is lifted three times,placed on the mat and the broom is put in his or her head and covered with calabash for a few seconds</p>
